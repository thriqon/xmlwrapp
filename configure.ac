dnl remember, "build" is where we compile, "host" is where the resulting
dnl program runs (which may be different from "build" for cross-compilation)
AC_CANONICAL_HOST


dnl === Command line options ===

AC_ARG_ENABLE(xslt,

AC_PROG_CXX
AC_PROG_LD
AC_PROG_LIBTOOL


dnl === Library checks ===

dnl use C++ compiler as we're checking for C++ libraries/headers from now on
dnl (we couldn't do it before as libtool tests must be done with C compiler)
AC_LANG(C++)

PKG_CHECK_MODULES(LIBXML, [libxml-2.0 >= 2.4.28])

if test "x$build_xslt" = "xyes" ; then

AC_HEADER_ASSERT

dnl === Compiler-specific stuff ===

if test "x$GCC" == "xyes"; then
    dnl Enable some useful warnings that GCC supports:
    CXXFLAGS="$CXXFLAGS -W -Wall -Wcast-align -Wwrite-strings"
fi

dnl Check if the compiler supports symbols visibility:
XMLWRAPP_VISIBILITY

dnl === Generate output files ===

dnl This is support for the legacy xmlwrapp-config script, which has to behave
dnl as it did in 0.5.x, i.e. output flags for both libxmlwrapp and
dnl libxsltwrapp and also include dependency libs' flags for static linking
LEGACY_LINK_FLAGS="-lxmlwrapp $LIBXML_LIBS"
if test "x$build_xslt" = "xyes" ; then
    LEGACY_LINK_FLAGS="-lxsltwrapp $LIBEXSLT_LIBS $LIBXSLT_LIBS $LEGACY_LINK_FLAGS"
